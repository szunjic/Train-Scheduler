# Train-Scheduler

#### HW #7 for The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin

For this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

My app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. 

My website will also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. 

When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:
	
	* Train Name

	* Destination 

	* First Train Time — in military time

	* Frequency — in minutes 

I coded this app to calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.

Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.
